# HAS Tools: Course Materials for Fall 2024


This repository contains course contents for HWRS 401/501 "Tools for Data Handling and Analysis in Water, Weather, & Climate" also known as "HAS Tools".  This course is intended to introduce the basics of the modern data science stack for water, weather, and climate research. Folks from other Earth/environmental fields should also find useful lessons here.

The structure of this repository is roughly as follows:

 - `admin`: Contains details related to administration of the class including the syllabus and notes about structuring the course.
 - `slides`: Contains slides from lectures (as appropriate) as pdf files or jupyter notebooks.
 - `coding_modules`: Code that will be used for hands-on portions of the course.
 - `data`: Sample datasets that will be used in class.
 - `cheat_sheets`: Some cheat sheets for remembering various commands/concepts.
 - `exercises`: Copies of homework assignments - do not use these - please use the homework assignments in your individual repositories.
